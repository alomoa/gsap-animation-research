- Fluid transition between these two hover states. Cute. It snaps back when you no longer hover. **Idea**

- Title lines appeared one by one from bottom to top and at a slight angle. Like a submarine that just resurfaces. **Idea**

- This is cool >_<

- There's alot going on here. Wadafak. I do like the lights slowly flickering and some of the patterns in the background "breathing". Page feels alive **Idea**
- The contrast makes it hard to read the text >_< **BAD IDEA**


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79b5afd3-363e-41be-9050-5d4c4fb94577
- I like this loading screen! **Idea?**

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5202c0bc-9c5a-4067-b10d-23ba80056b39
- Checkerboard rendering of images. (Thought they were sections, they lie! Still cool)

- Double whammy. The way the text characters jumped off **Idea**
- I like how the paragraph text appears. Similar submarine feel to an animation mentioned above but for paragraph text. **Idea**

- The intro animation is hawwwt. The changing of colours sliding in sychronously with the changing of some of the words. oof.  **Idea**

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ea0c506-024e-469b-b9cc-9c6c9cbc6d80
- Hover effect. Zoom zoom. **Idea**

- I like this. Seems abit much. Mabe we can tone it down. Unsure if the pixel transition effect was done with gsap but I'm sure we can do the rest with it. Could be a good idea for showcasing Artifex's projects. Hover over a card and WABAM, out appears some screenshots to the foreground while everything but the hovered card greys out to the background. :D **Idea**

- Stagger and bounce. Textbook xD


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61c707ca-0a2f-454e-accd-df5f845e7a10
- This is cute. Tree + grinding + almonds = whatever that baked good is. Could do something similar with what the Atrifex members created? Avatars/headshots = images of the work/artwork they created (with permission) **Idea**


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7566f831-1cac-46f5-be73-7f2a327a66f2
- Not an idea. Just a shout out to Tabs' spinning globe animation

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/272619c9-acd1-497a-8642-7cfc93cc4af9
- Maybe we could do this hover effect with our cards? **Idea**
- Also see the cursor effect. So cool


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68570df9-a28c-4453-8b4b-534068ff2b55
